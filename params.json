I am very passionate about machine learning and information retieval.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nThe Internet is the global system of interconnected mainframe, personal, and wireless computer networks that use the Internet protocol suit (TCP/IP) to link billions of devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope.The Web has also enabled individuals and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay.\r\n\r\n## PageRanking Algorithm\r\nIn “PageRank” the page word is not for web page though it is used for ranking pages.The PageRank algorithm originally developed at Stanford University by Larry Page in 1996 as part of a research project about a new search engine. So it got its name from Larry Page.PageRank is an algorithm used by the Google web search engine to rank websites in their search engine results. The PageRank algorithm does not rank the whole website, but it’s determined for each page individually.\r\n\r\n### Formulae and methods\r\nFormula for calculating the web page rank :\r\n\r\n           PR(A)=(1-d)+d(PR(T1)/C(T1)+………+ PR(Tn)/C(Tn))\r\n\r\nWhere: \r\n             PR(A)  = PageRank of page A\r\n             T1….Tn=All pages that link to page A \r\n             PR(Ti)   =Page rank of page Ti \r\n             C(Ti)     =the number of pages to which Ti links to \r\n                   d     =damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1 \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out [documentation](https://github.com/ankitraj077/implementing-PageRank-algorithm-using-java.git) or [contact support](ankit.raj.077@gamil.com) and I’ll help you sort it out.",
